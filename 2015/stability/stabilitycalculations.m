% Simple stability analysis by analyzing eigenvalues of matrix A. Here we
% think the differential equations as x'(t) = A* x(t) +b(t), where x',x and
% b are vectors. This system is linear, so the method can be used.

% !! With long parameter vectors the calculations will get slow fast!

% Parameters we are interested in.
% I have no idea what these should be...... :D
