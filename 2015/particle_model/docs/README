A simple tool to model movements in a particle
-----------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------
DEPENDENCIES:
-----------------------------------------------
This model needs python 3, matplotlib, numpy and scipy to function.
-----------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------
USAGE:
-----------------------------------------------
currently there is no UI, so an user has to change the values presented in the source code.
This is cumbersome and dangerous, and some changes are needed. This is
in the feature list/todo-list.
Please do not edit vector2.py or objects.py, as these are needed for the correct function of
this model.
-----------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------
ALGORITHM:
-----------------------------------------------
1. Place enzymes and substrates in a container (circle with a radius)
2. With every timestep, move the enzymes and substrates.
Then, check if substrates are near enzymes. If they are, try to react them.
That has a probability of happening. If it happens, change the substrate to 
a different substrate.
3. repeat
4. After enough repetition, plot a curve from the amounts of the particles.

FEATURE REQUESTS:
-----------------------------------------------
This is a list of features that I (or you) want to get implemented in this
model. These features may or may not be implemented, but every one of them 
is checked for viability and relevance. If you have ideas about this model, then 
let's discuss things and add your siggestion!
Suggestions that have to do with pretty visualization/things "looking cool"
are currently put to the end of the list.
-----------------------------------------------

1. Business indicator for enzymes and substrates alike, so that the model can
account for enzymes and substrates being in an intermediate state,
and this would also speed up the simulation.

2. Is it better to iterate the substrates and enzymes as enzyme->sub or sub->enz?
If sub->enz, no substrate is bonded twice. If enz->sub, might be easier to
parallelize, but might also iterate more -> waste resources when compared
to the other situation.

3. A text-based UI/ settings file (to give input to the program without
having to edit the code). This is easy but takes a long time, but is also needed
for easy use of the model. Other thing that is perhaps more time-critical is a
batch-running script, so that we can have some data to decide if we should have
the micelles created.

4. Parallelization (create different threads for each enzyme?). This needs more work, as
currently I have no knowledge of how this can be implemented. One problem is the way
problem of multibonding: if 2 threads are bonding to the same substrate, how do
we settle this conflict? two substrates should NOT bond to same enzyme, that is
not smart. 

5. Find out the connection between particle mass, temperature, dt, and delta
in brownian motion. currently I have no idea how these affect each other, only
that mass makes particles slower and temperature raises speed. Delta is the 
speed modifier, so how ideally we should define delta from mass and temperature.

6. 3D space instead of 2D, since 2D may be too simplified. This is almost trivial,
and can be implemented in say, 3 hours.

7. A way to load the simulation parameters from a file and to save simulation data in a file.
This is relevant, since we can only get the data from a cluster in a file, I think.

8. A graphical UI (for ease of access, though may be a bit hard to implement).
This should be one of the last things to implement, as it is not so relevant to
our modeling (we should make batch runs on aalto's cluster + make the model itself
better)

FQA/Frequently Questioned Answers:
-------------------------------------------------
Q:What is the "profiling_data"-folder? can i delete it?
A:profiling_data has information about the performance of the program.
This includes a specific list of the function calls the program makes, 
as well as the times this takes. Prifiling data is important when people
are searching for bottlenecks in their code. To answer your questin, no, 
it should not be deleted. Neither should anything else, unless you know that
it is obsolete.
Q: 
A: NO.
