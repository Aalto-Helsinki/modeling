A simple tool to model movements in a particle
-----------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------
DEPENDENCIES:
-----------------------------------------------
This model needs python 3, matplotlib, numpy and scipy to function.
-----------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------
USAGE:
-----------------------------------------------
currently there is no UI, so an user has to change the values presented in the source code.
This is cumbersome and dangerous, and some changes are needed.
Please do not edit vector2.py or objects.py, as these are needed for the correct function of
this model.
-----------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------
ALGORITHM:
-----------------------------------------------
1. Place enzymes and substrates in a container (circle with a radius)
2. With every timestep, move the enzymes and substrates.
Then, check if substrates are near enzymes. If they are, try to react them.
That has a probability of happening. If it happens, change the substrate to 
a different substrate.
3. repeat
4. After enough repetition, plot a curve from the amounts of the particles.

FEATURE REQUESTS:
-----------------------------------------------
This is a list of features that I (or you) want to get implemented in this
model. These features may or may not be implemented, but every one of them 
is checked for viability and relevance.
-----------------------------------------------
-Business indicator for enzymes and substrates alike, so that the model can
account for enzymes and substrates being in an intermediate state,
and this would also speed up the simulation.
-Is it better to iterate the substrates and enzymes as enzyme->sub or sub->enz?
If sub->enz, no substrate is bound twice. If enz->sub, might be easier to
parallelize, but might also iterate more -> waste resources when compared
to the other situation
-3D space instead of 2D, since 2D may be too simplified. This is almost trivial,
and can be implemented in say, 3 hours.
-Parallelization (create different threads for each enzyme?). This needs more work, as
currently I have no knowledge of how this can be implemented.
-A text-based UI/ settings file (to give input to the program without
having to edit the code). This is easy but takes a long time
-A graphical UI (for ease of access, though may be a bit hard to implement).
This should be one of the last things to implement, as it is not so relevant to
our modeling (we should make batch runs on aalto's cluster + make the model itself
better)
